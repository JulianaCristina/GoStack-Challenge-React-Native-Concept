	<h1>GoStack Bootcamp Challenge - React Native Concepts  </h1>
</div>

### About the challenge :rocket:
In this challenge, an application was created to train what 
I hav``e learned so far in React Native, using the API created on [Node.js challenge](https://github.com/JulianaCristina/GoStack-Challenge-Nodejs-Concept)!

This will be an application to store repositories in your portfolio, which will allow the creation, listing, updating and removal of the repositories, and also allow the repositories to receive "likes".
